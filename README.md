# UFOs

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to create a webpage using Javascript to track UFO sightings. This data is displayed by building a table to hold UFO data. 

## How to Use this Webpage 
This table can be used to filter on multiple criteria. A user will simply type the desired criteria in one or multiple of the fields. The user will then hit enter, and the table will be filtered showing the appropriate UFO sightings.

## Summary 
One drawback of this design is that there is no filter button, as a result the user could be confused about what to do next. For further development I would recommend connecting this site to a live data source so users can see data in real time. I would also add a filter for the comments columm, to find any comments with words users type in.
